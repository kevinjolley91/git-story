I went to the store.
I bought groceries and drinks.
I went home and ate everything.
I got sick.
I don't go shopping anymore.I started starving.
I try to be smarter about food now.
I eat at Wendy's often. I love Baconators.
I sometimes get Arby's. Those curly fries though.
Now I want McDonald's hash browns.
